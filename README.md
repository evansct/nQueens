# nQueens
A java solution to the n queens problem, including a GUI using swing

This is not a very efficient solution, nor is it very well designed, however I plan on coming back to it at some point to clean it up. The current version was completed on May 4th, 2017.

In order to run, download the files and open them in your favorite java IDE, they were written using eclipse.
